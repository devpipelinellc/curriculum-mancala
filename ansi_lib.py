'''
ansi_lib.py is a collection of classes and functions that implement many
of the ANSI Escape Code functionality for VT100 terminals. It is designed
to replace libraries such as the curses and msvcrt libraries. It is 
cross-platform compatible and is not dependent on native-code libraries.

With this "module", you can control many aspects of the command-line terminal
such as color, cursor position, erasing the terminal, or parts of the terminal
and printing text to the screen at any position.

The code itself was written to be understandable for those just learning to
code and, therefore, it is not necessarily "pythonic", nor optimized for speed
or space.
